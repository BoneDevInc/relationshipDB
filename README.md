# Relationship DB

Discord E-Dating database.

## Client component: Vencord Userplugin

Install the [userplugin.tsx](userplugin.tsx) in your Vencord src/userplugins/ folder. 


## Server component: Wedlock

There will eventually be a hosted server with address already provided in the userplugin.tsx. For now you can run the server by using ./gradlew run.

If you want to host the server or change the application id, make sure to not only update the userplugin.tsx, but also the Discord authentication on the server.
